# Fusion
Video Streaming receiver, manager, integrator from multiple channels with an FFmpeg wrapper that creates and controls external processes.
Uses Win32, C++, FFmpeg as an external util which is called as a process.

Could be used as a reference for Win32 API functions: multiple monitors, windows, enumeration and finding windows, resizing, movement, creation of frameless windows; capturing window content and redrawing - DIB bitmap bitblt operations; shell operations, process creation, UDP and HTTP services, wrapping other processes windows inside another application window, using RawInput (to detect clicks on external windows, without using the complicated Hook-functions), some FFmpeg commands, simple config-file function, a very simple "security"/registration function (good enough for users), STL vector and map, threads, a watch-dog, simple timers with WM_TIMER, GDI+ ...

Created in 2013. An update 1.2 from 2014.
